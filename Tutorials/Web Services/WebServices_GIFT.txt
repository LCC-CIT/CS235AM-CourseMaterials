::Web services::
Match the Web service types on the left with the correct description on the right. { 
=REST -> Simple to consume, platform independant, based on HTTP 
=WCF -> Microsoft specific technology 
=SOAP-> Standards based, allows providers to abstract data and trasport implementation
}

//2
::REST Client Libraries::
Which of the following are classes that are part of the .NET/Mono framework and could be used to implement a REST client? {
~%-33.33333%RestSharp

~%33.33333%WebClient
~%33.33333%HttpWebResponse
}

//3
::HttpWebRequest, HttpWebResponse::
Match the descriptions of the steps to make and consume a REST request on the left with the matching lines of code on the right. (Assume var restUri \= string.Format( @"http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/REST/RxTerms/rxcui/\{0\}/allinfo", rxcui );
{ 
=Creating the request instance for a particular URI -> var request \= HttpWebRequest.Create(restUri, rxcui));
=Setting the response data format property on the request instance -> request.ContentType \= "application/json"; 
=Setting request method properties on the request instance -> request.Method \= "GET"; 
=Retrieving an HttpWebResponse from the request -> var HttpWebResponse response \= request.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;
=Read data out of the response -> StreamReader reader \= new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream();
}

//4
::Asynch callback::
In the sample code, in the section, Calling Services Asynchronously, which of the following methods will be called first when the web service issues an asynchronous response? {
~ViewDidAppear
~BeginInvokeOnMainThread
~GetRxTermAsynch
=FinishedGettingDrugConcept
~ReloadData
}

//5

~%-33.33333%XHTML
}

//6
