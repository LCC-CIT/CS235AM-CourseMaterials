**Course Description**

This course introduces students to mobile application programming concepts and mobile application development methodology using the Android Software Development Kit, Java programming language, and the Android Studio IDE.

**Learning Outcome**

Design the core logic for a mobile software application. Write, debug, and test the code for the core logic for an application. Design User that interoperate with the core logic. Evaluate mobile app designs and architectures in terms of UX (User eXperience), performance, and maintainability.

**Time Commitment**

Since this is a 4-credit class, you will need to spend 4 hours a week in class or engaging with content online and 8 hours a week studying, taking quizzes, writing code and doing code reviews. This comes to a total of 12 hours a weekfor the typical student.

**Course Web Site**

[http://classes.lanecc.edu](http://classes.lanecc.edu/) is the address for the LCC Moodle site. Course learning materials and activities will be managed through the course Moodle page.



**Computers and Tablets**

Computers with Android Studio, and an Android Emulator are provided in the classroom. There are also Google Nexus 7 Android tablets available for student use in the classroom. Students may also bring their own computers and Android phones or tablets for use in class.

 Computers with the software required for the course are also available to all students in the CIT Main Lab in building 19, room 135. 

You may install all the software needed for this course on your own computer. Android Studio is free anad is available for Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Chrome OS. 

  

###Learning Activities

**Lab Assignments**

These are programing projects that you will do on your own- either using the computers and software in the CIT lab, or using your own computer and software. Students will submit both a *beta* version and a *release* version of the software solution for each lab assignment. The *beta* version should be essentially complete. “Complete” means having working code that fulfill all the core requirements for the assignment, but it does not need to be bug free. The *release*version should fulfill all requirements and be bug fee.

 

**Code Reviews**

Students will be paired with a code review partner. The partners will evaluate each-other’s coding practices as well as the functionality of each software solution. Students will use input from the code review to revise their code prior to submitting the *release*version of their software solution.

 

**Quizzes**

Weekly quizzes are given over the reading and exercises in the textbook as a way to focus students on the most important concepts in textbook chapters covered. 

 

**Term Project**

The requirements for the term project will be posted on Moodle.

 

**Weekly Learning Activities**

Monday

- Do a code review of last week's lab work for your lab partner

Tuesday

- Take the reading quiz

Friday

- Post a beta version of this week's lab assignment so your lab partner can review it.   
- Submit the release version of last week's lab assignment.

**Assessment and Grading**

Specific grading criteria will be applied to each of the labs, quizzes, and exams you will be working on in this class. 

The table below summarizes the percentage of your total grade given for each assessment task:

| **Learning & Assessment Activities** | **Number** | **% each** | **Total %** |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **Labs**                             | 8          | 5%         | 40%         |
| **Code Reviews**                     | 8          | 1%         | 8%          |
| **Quizzes**                          | 8          | 1%         | 8%          |
| **Term Project**                     | 1          | 44%        | 44%         |

 

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:                                 

| **Letter** | **-**    |         | **+**    |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| *A*        | 90 - 91  | 92 – 97 | 98 - 100 |
| **B**      | 80 - 81  | 82 – 87 | 88 - 89  |
| **C**      | 70 – 71  | 72 – 77 | 78 - 79  |
| **D**      | 60 - 61  | 62 – 67 | 68 - 69  |
| **F**      | Below 60 |         |          |

  

**Late Work**

- Grades for code reviews will be reduced by 25%if either the beta version or code review are submitted late.
- Grades for lab release versions submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%
- Quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date. Plan ahead!Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.

 

**Academic Honesty**

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can’t copy any part of someone else’s work. The end product must be each student’s own individual work.

 

**Attendance**

Attendance is not graded, but to succeed, you must:

- Engage in the lectures in person or via live or recorded video
- Participate in class activities either online or in the classroom

 

**No Show Drop**

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week, on-campus students must physically attend at least one class session. Online students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.
